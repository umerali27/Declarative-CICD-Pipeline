# Declarative CI/CD Pipeline on AWS

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins Declarative Pipeline, Docker, Terraform, and AWS.  
The goal is to automate application build, containerization, infrastructure provisioning, and deployment using DevOps best practices.

## Architecture Overview

**Workflow:**
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. Jenkins pipeline is triggered
3. Application is built and containerized using Docker
4. Docker container runs the application
5. Infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform on AWS

**Core Components:**
- GitHub – Source code management
- Jenkins – CI/CD automation
- Docker – Containerization
- Terraform – Infrastructure as Code
- AWS EC2 – Compute infrastructure
